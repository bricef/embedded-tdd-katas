# What I mean by Embedded

---

# Embedded systems constraints

- Resource constraints
- Lack of standard libraries
- No or limited filesystem
- Limited Interface (serial? UART, SWI)

---
<!-- _class: invert -->

# Craftsmanship for Embedded

---

# Dual targeting

- Dual targeting
  - Target bottleneck
  - Running the test suite on the target

---

# Nested Testing Cycles

---

# CI and automated HW tests

  
---

# Advanced Mocking

Advanced Mocking
    1. Mock the clock
    2. Test doubles
      1. Code structure & Link time substitution
      2. Function pointer substitution
      3. Syntactic substitution (preprocessor)

# Simulators

---

# SOLID

  1. Single Responsibility Principle
  2. Open Closed Principle
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle
  4. Interface Segregation Principle
  5. Dependency Inversion Priciple
