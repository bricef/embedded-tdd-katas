# Logistics and Wifi

üöΩ Behind the main screen to the right of the corridor.

üõú Wifi is **The Bradfield Centre** password is **Ca3Br1d5e**

üö® We do not expect alarms. Assume a fire alarm is real and make your way to the car park.

# What is "Embedded"

---

# Embedded constraints

- Resource constraints (RAM, CPU)
- Lack of standard libraries
- No or limited filesystem
- Limited Interface (serial? UART, SWI)
- No Operating System
- No standard library
- Direct hardware access
- Lack of MMU/PMMU

--- 

# Special pains

- Late hardware delivery
- Hardware scarcity
- Hardware bugs
- Long target compile times
- Long target setup and upload time
- Compiler licenses

---

# Embedded Strategy

---

# Dual targeting

- Dual targeting
  - Simulate hard-to-duplicate conditions
  - Get around target bottleneck
  - Running the test suite locally
  - Automated CI 

---

# Embedded TDD Cycles

![width:1080px](./assets/tdd-cycles.png)

---

# Automated HW tests

- There's no reason why you can't create an automated harness that runs the unit test on test devices.

- There's no reason why your CI builds couldn't use HW tests. Including cloud runners!

- You might want to ship tests in production devices as part of a HW self-test suite.
  
_We won't go into depth in this topic tonight._

# Test Doubles

![bg right](assets/mockingbird.jpg)

- Crititcal for embedded
- Mock the HAL
- Mock the clock

---

# How to Mock?

In order of preference

  1. Link time substitution
  (Requires appropriate code structure)
  2. Function pointer substitution
  3. Syntactic substitution (preprocessor)

Combine at will...
      
---

# Simulators

Allow testing compiled target code in CI.

Run entire test suite.

Go hand-in-hand with Test Doubles.

# Craftsmanship fundamentals still matter

---

# SOLID

  1. Single Responsibility Principle
  2. Open Closed Principle
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle
  4. Interface Segregation Principle
  5. Dependency Inversion Priciple

# The Katas

---

# LED Driver Kata 

Look at `KATA.md` in `Code/src/leddriver` 

---

# Interrupt Kata

Look at `KATA.md` in `Code/src/interrupt` 

---
<!-- _class: invert -->

# Recap

---

# What we learnt

1. TDD is possible and _useful_ for embedded software.
2. Embedded TDD strategies make the process easier.
3. Dual targeting is worth it.

(C is fun, maybe?)
