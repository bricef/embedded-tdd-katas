# Logistics and Wifi

üöΩ Behind the main screen to the right of the corridor.

üõú Wifi is **The Bradfield Centre** password is **Ca3Br1d5e**

üö® We do not expect alarms. Assume a fire alarm is real and make your way to the car park.

# Plan for this evening

1. TDD Refresh
2. What we mean by "embedded"
3. Embedded craftsmanship practices
4. The Katas
    1. LED Driver Kata 
    2. Interrupt Kata
5. Recap

# What I mean by Embedded

---

# Embedded constraints

- Resource constraints (RAM, CPU)
- Lack of standard libraries
- No or limited filesystem
- Limited Interface (serial? UART, SWI)
- No Operating System
- No standard library
- Direct hardware access
- Lack of MMU/PMMU

--- 

# Special pains

- Late hardware delivery
- Hardware scarcity
- Hardware bugs
- Long target compile times
- Long target setup and upload time
- Compiler licenses

---
<!-- _class: invert -->

# Craftsmanship for Embedded

---

# Dual targeting

- Dual targeting
  - Simulate hard-to-duplicate conditions
  - Target bottleneck
  - Running the test suite on the target

---

# Embedded TDD Cycles

---

# CI and automated HW tests

  
---

# Advanced Mocking

Advanced Mocking
    1. Mock the clock
    2. Test doubles
      1. Code structure & Link time substitution
      2. Function pointer substitution
      3. Syntactic substitution (preprocessor)
      
---

# Simulators

---

# SOLID

  1. Single Responsibility Principle
  2. Open Closed Principle
  3. Liskov Substitution Principle
  4. Interface Segregation Principle
  5. Dependency Inversion Priciple
